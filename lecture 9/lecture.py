#heap
#min-hip, max-hip

# binary tree
# - can have 0, 1, 2 nodes
# - cannot have more than 2 nodes. if it does, it is NOT a binary tree
# **Binary tree will be on final exam (1 question)**
# - Ex) binary tree is given. is it completed binary tree? if not, redraw it.
# - binary tree nodes must be inserted left to right order. cannot skip a node.

# heap order property
# - child must be greater than parent.
# - parent of the node must have higher priority 
# - child node must have lower priority
# - min heap : it means all the parents are smaller than their child
# - exam example: can you create min or max heap?
# - ** try not to insert duplicated elements

# another way to create min heap or max heap
# "Heapify method"
# - 1. create complete binary tree without worrying about sorting
# - 2. and sort. (Swap)
